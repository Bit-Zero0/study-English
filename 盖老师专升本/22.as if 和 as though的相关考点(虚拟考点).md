# 考点
【现在用过去,过去用过去的过去】
如果虚拟条件句的谓语部分有were,had ,should时,**可省略if,把were,had,should放到从句主语前,形成倒装**



# 实例
1. He acts **as if** he knew me.他显得认识我似的.

2. He was singing **as though/if** he hadn't had a care in the world. 他喝着歌,好像人世间他没有忧虑.

3. **Were** she my daughter,...(=lf she were my daughter...)如果她是我女儿....

4. **lf** l were to do that== **Were** I to do that,  what would you say?  如果我做了那件事,你会说什么呢?

5. **Should** you change you mind,...(=**If** you should change...)要是你改变主意.

6. **Should** enemy soldiers spot you, open fire immediately. (**If** enemy soldiers should spot you...)万一敌兵发现你,马上开枪.

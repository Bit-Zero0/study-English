在主动语态变为被动语态时，主动语态的主语在被动语态中要变为“by +宾格”。

那Everybody knows the fact.的被动语态是The fact is known by everybody.吗？不是的，这是错误的句子。

`be known by`的意思是“**通过……得知**”，用于表示判断的标准。

看下面的两个例子：
`A tree is known by its fruits.`看果实就知道树。
`A man is known by the company he keeps.` 从其交友，知其为人。

变成被动语态时，不是全都用by，有时也会用by以外的其他介词。这些都是习惯性用法，所以只能背下来。

只需要背下最重要的10个惯用搭配就可以了。

## 小总结
`be made of`是物理性变化，`be made from`是化学性变化，这可能有点难理解。
物理变化是指树木变成书桌、石头变成台阶等只是形态发生变化，而化学变化是指黄豆变成黄酱、牛奶变成奶酪等成分完全改变的变化。
因此，物理变化很简单，化学变化很复杂。简单的变化用`of`，复杂的变化用`from`。

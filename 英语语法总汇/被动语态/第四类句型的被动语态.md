# 第四类句型的被动语态
主动语态变成被动语态时，要先找到宾语，然后把宾语变成主语。

下面我们就来看一下第四类句型如何变成被动语态。

再看一个例子

在事物作主语的第四类句型的被动语态中，**为了更明确地表达出“给某人”，可以在“某人”前加上`to`**。

**English** is taught **to** us by her.

**The book** was given **to** Shrek (by you).


## 例句
① Shrek gave Princess Fiona the ring.
人作主语PrincessFiona was given the ring by Shrek.
事物作主语Thering was given (to) Princess Fiona by Shrek.

② My girlfriend gave me a present.
人作主语I was given a present by my girlfriend.
事物作主语A present was given (to) me by my girlfriend.


# 第四类句型变为被动语态时的注意事项

来看下面的句子。
She made me a cake. 她给我做了一个蛋糕。
这个句子也是由“**主语+谓语+间宾（人）+直宾（事物）**”构成第四类句型。把这个句子变成被动语态时，间接宾语人可以作主语，直接宾语事物也可以作主语。

## (1)事物作主语的被动语态
A cake was made me by her.
事物作主语时，为了明确表示给某人，可以在人（间接宾语）前加上to。

A cake was made to me by her. 这个句子正确吗？这是错误的句子。

前面刚刚说过可以加上`to`，怎么会是错误的句子呢？正确的句子应该是`A cake was made for me by her`.
那什么时候用`to`，什么时候用`for`呢？在学习句子的五种类型时，我们已经学过了这一点。可以翻到前面的“[[第四类句型#第四类句型变为第三类句型|第四类句型变为第三类句型的方法]]”部分复习一下。

### 例句
 Shrek bought Princess Fiona Fiona a coat.史莱克给菲奥娜公主买了一件外套。
→ A fur coat was bought to Princess Fiona by Shrek.(×)
→ A fur coat was bought for Princess Fiona by Shrek.(√)

He asked me some questions. 他问了我几个问题。
→ Some questions were asked to me by him. (×)
→ Some questions were asked of me by him. (√)

第四类句型的被动语态中，事物作主语时，谓语是某些特定的动词时，要用`for`代替`to`。虽然`to`可以省略，但是`for`或`of`必须写出来，不能省略。


### (2)人作主语的被动语态
`She made me a cake`. 她给我做了一个蛋糕。
这个句子变成事物作主语的被动语态就是`A cake was made for me by her.`

下面我们来看如何将整个句子变成人作主语的被动语态。

**I was made a cake by her.**

这个句子的意思是“我被她做了一个蛋糕。”这种表述是错误的。==**make作谓语的第四类句型，不能变成人作主语的被动语态，只能变成事物作主语的被动语态**==。

She made me a cake.
→ I was made a cake by her. (×) → 人不能作主语
→ A cake was made for me by her. (√)→ 事物可以作主语

含有某些动词的第四类句型是不能变成人作主语的被动语态的。这样的动词有`write`,`make`, `send`, `bring`, `read`, `buy`, `sell`等。

用这些动词作谓语的第四类句型变成被动语态时，只能变成事物作主语的被动语态。

#### 例句
**He wrote me a letter.** 他给我写了一封信。
如果人作主语
→ I was written a letter by him.(×) 我被他写了一封信。句子意思很奇怪，write作谓语时，不能变成人作主语的被动语态。
→ A letter was written (to) me by him. (√)

 **I sold Shrek my old car**. 我把我的旧车卖给了史莱克。→ My old car was sold to Shrek by me. (√) → 事物可以作主语
→ Shrek was sold my old car by me. (×) → 人不能作主语

**Shrek bought Princess Fiona a watch**. 史莱克给菲奥娜公主买了一块手表。
→ A watch was bought for Princess Fiona by Shrek. (√)→ 事物可以作主语
→ Princess Fiona was bought a watch by Shrek. (×) →人不能作主语

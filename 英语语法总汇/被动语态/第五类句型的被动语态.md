# 第五类句型的被动语态

**第五类句型的结构**是“==**主语+谓语+宾语+宾语补足语**==”。

下面我们就来看看如何把第五类句型变成被动语态。

They  call me a genius.
① 把宾语移到前面。`I...`
② 把动词变成`be + p.p.`。时态是现在时，所以把call变成`am called`。`I am called...`
③ 把宾语补足语放在谓语后。`I am called a genius...`
④ 把主语变成“by +宾语”。`I am called a genius bythem...`

## 例句
① I think him a doctor.→ He is thought a doctor by me.

② We called him a spy.→ He was called a spy by us.

③ We elected Bush a President.→ Bush was elected a President by us.

④ You make me crazy.→ I am made crazy by you.
